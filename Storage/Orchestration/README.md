### Practical Task 1: Deploy a Docker Container to Azure Container Instances (ACI) via Azure
### Portal
#### Requirements:
1. **Create a lightweight Docker image for a simple web application (e.g., a Python Flask app)**
**with minimal dependencies to reduce resource usage.**
2. **Push the Docker image to Azure Container Registry (ACR) using a low-cost storage option.**
3. **Use a lightweight ACI instance (e.g., B1s) to deploy the Docker container from ACR.**
4. **Verify the deployment by accessing the web application via the public IP address provided**
**by ACI.**
5. **Remove the ACI container after verifying the deployment to stop billing.**
