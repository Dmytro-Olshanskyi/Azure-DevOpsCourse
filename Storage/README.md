#### Requirements:
1. **Create a storage account and a Blob container named "lifecycle-container."**
2. **Upload multiple files of varying sizes to the container.**
3. **Create a lifecycle management policy to move blobs to the Cool tier after 30 days and**
**delete blobs older than 90 days.**
4. **Simulate policy execution by manually testing with different file creation timestamps.**
5. **Verify that blobs are moved or deleted according to the policy.**

### Practical Task 3: Implementing an Azure Queue for Message Storage
